I am a Data Scientist and Analytics professional with over twelve years of experience in unsupervised and supervised machine learning, optimization, and simulation. I received my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from the University of South Florida. I also received a M.S. in Industrial Engineering from there.

After spending 7 years in beautiful and sunny Florida, I moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the shores of mighty Lake Michigan as an Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering (Operations Research Focus) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. After over 4 great years at UWM, I moved to the Data Science and Big Data Analytics Industry as a Senior Data Scientist.

I worked at Impetus as a Senior Data Scientist, before joining IBM as the Practice Head for Data Science and Engineering in IT Operations Analytics (ITOA).
